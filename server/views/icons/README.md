# The icons

This collection of icons comes directly from https://heroicons.com/, but I only use the one I use.

Unfortunately importing the React version of the package doesn't work in our setup, also because React is required by that package and we don't have it.

I also added, to each icon:
```
    style={{ width: '18px', height: '18px' }}
    aria-hidden="true"
```
