Doing:

  MVP
  - tables in the editor
  - formatDate needs to be aware of the current locale
  - when we catch an error, we should log what it is. The ErrorWithFeedback should augment the original error object
  - there are several db access in the dbservice not protected by try catch
  - probably remove the image-macro now that we have the floating menu
  - collection of actions for audit purposes (log)
  - the couchdb scripts and compose file must be even more parametric

  NEXT
  - add a classification to the documents (like 'Internal only', 'Public'...)
  - Consider using [minisearch](https://github.com/lucaong/minisearch)
  - editing the page doesn't take into account the settings.textSize
  - Consider rate limiting the magic link generation
  - Fetch the preview for links?
  - use the can() API to enable/disable the buttons on the bubblemenu (https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/api/editor#can)
  - immersive read / immersive edit
  - What about https://demo.umodoc.com/editor ?
  - Syntax hightlight? https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions/nodes/code-block-lowlight
  - use couchdb for the cache (see /docs/CACHE.md)

  LATER
  - consider putting deleted page in a Trash bin instead of deleting them (or "Archive")
  - allow to duplicate/copy a page (needs to specify parent?)
  - consider access implications to the history of docs
  - couchdb must be configured to run in production
  - we are always using 303 to redirect - check if that makes sense
  - do we need a "Revert to this version" for the history? (probably not)
  - uses CSRF for delete and move page? (probably not)
  - unit tests for the dbService would be good.
  - There is also Lexical as an possible replacement for tiptap, if needed
  - Do we still need the replaceReact plugin?
  - Add inline comments
  - move document metadata in their own document, instead of using the metadata flag

Done
- Save the history of a page
- Move a page to another parent
- Add the date of creation and update
- consider starting mongodb with a replicaset to enable transactions
- refactor the router creating services
- delete should also remove the history
- uses mongodb sanitizer
- move the page buttons to a dropdown
- Show history of pages
- show single history item
- user user input sanitizer
- uses CSRF for create and edit page
- bug: feedback shows differently from alpine and normal render
- needs also to check for uniqueness in the pageSlugs array
- find a way to not move the menu when we change page (load page with HTMX?)
- Consider Alpine global store for the state of the notifications
- consider creating an esbuild.js and simplify packages.json
- make the port for livereload a constant (for the CSP)
- use a fastify proxy for the livereload to 8001 and 8000
- consider just removing the need of pageId and use the _id field
- Rolling window for history? (not needed with couchdb)
- Some feedback errors must be renamed a bit because they are very mongo-like
- A long PRE breaks the layout
- a simple lock system should be in place
- how do we load the editor only when needed?
- pass the fastify instance to the views using context?
- internazionalization
- Check what happens if we cannot connect to the db on bootstrap
- make the name of the database configurable
- add a icon library (the chevron in pageMenu for example or in the message notifications)
- a page for the settings and then use them
- switch language from the settings
- to find one document, we need to use get(_id), not find() with a select and limit 1
- the error and success strings must be translated
- translate the content of the landing page
- better design for the search results
- set page title and page description in the settings
- Try errors with curl (ie /parts/nav/br0ken) and see why it does return
- use kitajs? https://github.com/kitajs/html
- we should be able to reorganize pages on the same level
- add the metadataOnly flag to the document
- we don't need clsx anymore
- we need an export of the page (backup / restore)
- keep the active item in the menu on back / forward
- refactor the names of the routes, like '/edit/:pageId' => '/pages/:pageId/edit'
- menu cache
- add the bubble menu to images (align, set dimensions)
- the editor icons' title is not translated
- use a real dialog to set image url and dimension
- better Mobile experience
- the error page uses the full layout (should use the mini). Try login with ss@nn
- the “Page updated” message needs to automatically disappears after a few seconds
- better handling oif the base_url
- supported languages for the ui
- Add logout functionality if desired
- find a way to pass the rep.user to the Layout
- silence the logs for assets
- magic link for logging in
- variable text size
- bulkLoad and exporter needs partial rewrite
- can't we just use the dbService in the App instead of the dbClient?
- we need to be sure to fix the 409s because they should not happen
- the search is not case sensitive, the title and the body must be lowercased
- rebuild index on create/delete/update and fix the things in LUNR.md
- search: use cheerio to remove html from the content
